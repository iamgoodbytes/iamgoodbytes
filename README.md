- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m GoodBytes!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a coder/teacher (full-time) and restaurant cook (part-time)
- ðŸŒ± Building prototypes and production-ready web apps is what I like to do most

I like to build API-based apps based on NodeJS and MongoDB, it just feels _right_.

Your apps deserve clean pixel-perfect interfaces built with reusable code.

I built my first web app in PHP almost 20 years ago and it still is one of my favourite languages, especially when combined with the Laravel framework.

What would the Internet be without Linux? I'm interested in server security and online privacy and can set up a server or deployment process for you and your team.

Dabbling with web3 development sure feels like the early days of web development, but more distributed. I write smart contracts and Dapps and teach introductory workshops about the possible future of web3.

We'll all be living in some kind of a MetaVerse soon enough, so adding a bit of ThreeJS to your toolkit definitely doesn't hurt!
